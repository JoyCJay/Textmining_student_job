Understanding the product’s ‘end-of-life’ is important to reduce the environmental impact of the
products’ final disposal. When the initial stages of product development consider end-of-life aspects,
which can be established by ecodesign (a proactive approach of environmental management that aims to
reduce the total environmental impact of products), it becomes easier to close the loop of materials. The
‘end-of-life’ ecodesign methods generally include more than one ‘end-of-life’ strategy. Since product
complexity varies substantially, some components, systems or sub-systems are easier to be recycled,
reused or remanufactured than others. Remanufacture is an effective way to maintain products in
a closed-loop, reducing both environmental impacts and costs of the manufacturing processes. This
paper presents some ecodesign methods focused on the integration of different ‘end-of-life’ strategies,
with special attention to remanufacturing, given its increasing importance in the international scenario
to reduce the life cycle impacts of products.
